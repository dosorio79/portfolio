A lightweight portfolio built to present projects and experience clearly, without unnecessary complexity or heavy frontend frameworks.

**Purpose**
Create a simple, fast website where content and projects are easy to browse on both desktop and mobile, avoiding the overhead of typical JavaScript-heavy portfolios.

**Approach**
Used Astro with Markdown-based content and Tailwind CSS to keep pages static, maintainable, and performance-focused while preserving a clean reading experience.

**Constraints**
Kept dependencies minimal, avoided SPA behavior, and prioritized accessibility and fast load times across devices.

**Recent updates**
Added project snapshots and architecture diagrams to give more context without turning the site into a feature-heavy application.

**Tech stack**
Astro · Tailwind CSS · TypeScript · Markdown
