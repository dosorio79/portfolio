Face detection and recognition on images and video for emergency monitoring in industrial safety contexts.

**Purpose**
Detect and recognize faces in safety monitoring footage to support rapid emergency response.

**Approach**
Built a transfer-learning pipeline for face detection/recognition and deployed it behind a FastAPI backend with a Streamlit interface for demos.

**Constraints**
Focused on images and video workflows with a lightweight demo deployment.

**Tech stack**
Python · OpenCV · MTCNN · TensorFlow · FastAPI · Streamlit
