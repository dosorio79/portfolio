Real-time collaborative coding interview platform with in-browser execution.

**Purpose**
Build a lightweight CoderPad-style experience that runs in the browser or a single container.

**Approach**
Implemented a React + Vite frontend with WebSocket sync, an Express backend for REST/WebSockets, and in-browser execution for JavaScript plus Pyodide for Python.

**Constraints**
Designed for one-origin deployment to avoid CORS and keep sessions stateless and ephemeral.

**Tech stack**
React · Vite · Express · WebSockets · Pyodide
