Module 1 homework: full CRUD TODO app with tests and a clean UI.

**Purpose**
Deliver a complete, tested CRUD app as a baseline for the course workflow.

**Approach**
Built a Django app with due dates, status toggles, and a clean Tailwind UI, backed by a full test suite and a Makefile for common tasks.

**Constraints**
Kept the stack simple with SQLite and a CDN-based Tailwind setup for quick iteration.

**Recent updates**
Added a screenshot for quick visual context.

**Tech stack**
Python · Django · Tailwind CSS · SQLite
