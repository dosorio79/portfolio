Streamlit app and CLI pipeline for asking questions about GitHub repo docs with an AI-powered agent.

**Purpose**
Build a practical Q&A workflow over documentation and show a usable interface beyond notebooks.

**Approach**
Ingested and chunked Markdown docs with multiple strategies, indexed with text/vector/hybrid search, and wired an OpenAI + Pydantic AI agent into both a Streamlit UI and a CLI.

**Constraints**
Kept the pipeline modular and focused on a clear path from experimentation to a working interface.

**Recent updates**
Added a UI snapshot and CLI diagram for quick context.
