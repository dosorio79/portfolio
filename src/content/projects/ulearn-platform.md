uLearn generates focused 15-minute lessons with a structured, agent-driven pipeline.
The backend orchestrates planning, content generation, and validation, then renders blocks for the frontend.
The React UI supports exports to Markdown and Jupyter notebooks and can execute Python snippets in-browser via Pyodide.
