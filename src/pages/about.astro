    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Identity</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I am a data scientist working at the intersection of pricing, experimentation,
      and applied machine learning. My work focuses on translating data into decisions
      that are measurable, explainable, and operational.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Before transitioning into industry, I spent nearly a decade in academic research
      studying cellular mechanics and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Scientific training
      shaped how I approach complex problems: define them precisely, measure carefully,
      and remain skeptical of conclusions until the evidence is clear.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Today, I apply the same rigor to real-world decision systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">The Bridge</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      Research taught me habits that continue to guide my work:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>reason under uncertainty</li>
      <li>design experiments that withstand scrutiny</li>
      <li>separate signal from noise</li>
      <li>favor clarity over unnecessary complexity</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">
      Whether building predictive models or supporting pricing strategies, my goal
      remains the same — produce insight that can be trusted and acted upon.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Academic Background</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      PhD-level training in biomedical sciences, followed by postdoctoral research in
      cell biology. My academic work resulted in multiple peer-reviewed publications
      and collaborations across international research environments.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-3">
      While the domain has changed, the underlying discipline has not: careful reasoning,
      reproducibility, and respect for evidence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Current Focus</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      I currently work on pricing and decision systems within financial services, with
      particular interest in:
    </p>
    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>uplift modeling and causal thinking</li>
      <li>experimentation in operational settings</li>
      <li>interpretable machine learning</li>
      <li>the interface between statistical models and business decisions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-4">
      More broadly, I am interested in how models survive contact with reality — and
      what it takes to make them useful beyond the notebook.

    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">How I Work</h2>
    <p class="mt-3">
      My approach is shaped by scientific practice: start from first principles,
      challenge assumptions early, and prefer robust solutions over fashionable ones.
      I value environments where intellectual honesty and pragmatic execution coexist.
