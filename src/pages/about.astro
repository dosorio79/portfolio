    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Identity</h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I am a data scientist working at the intersection of pricing,
      experimentation, and applied machine learning. My work focuses on
      translating data into decisions that are measurable, explainable,
      and operational.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Before moving into industry, I spent almost two decades in academic
      research studying cellular mechanics and the actomyosin cytoskeleton.
      Modern cell biology relies heavily on data analysis and computational
      tools, from microscopy systems to large-scale screening experiments,
      and this environment shaped how I approached problem solving from
      early on.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Over time, I deliberately focused more on programming and data analysis,
      investing in structured training and hands-on projects to deepen those
      skills and transition into applied data science roles in industry.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Today, I apply the same rigor to real-world decision systems, where
      models must not only be correct, but also useful and robust once
      deployed and used to guide decisions.

  <!-- THE BRIDGE -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">The Bridge</h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Research left me with habits that continue to guide how I work:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>reason under uncertainty</li>
      <li>design experiments that withstand scrutiny</li>
      <li>separate signal from noise</li>
      <li>favor clarity over unnecessary complexity</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Whether supporting pricing strategies or building predictive systems,
      the goal remains the same: produce insight that people can trust and
      act upon.

  <!-- ACADEMIC BACKGROUND -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">
      Academic Background
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      My academic training includes doctoral and postdoctoral research in
      biomedical sciences, resulting in peer-reviewed publications and
      collaborations across international research groups.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      While the domain changed, the discipline did not: careful reasoning,
      reproducibility, and respect for evidence remain central to how I work.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CURRENT FOCUS -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">
      Current Focus
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I currently work on pricing and decision systems within financial
      services, with particular interest in:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>marketing targeting and customer experience optimization</li>
      <li>experimentation in operational environments</li>
      <li>interpretable and production-ready machine learning</li>
      <li>bridging analytical models and business decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Outside production work, I also build and experiment with learning
      platforms and AI-assisted workflows, exploring how modern AI tools can
      support better decisions and knowledge transfer.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      More broadly, I am interested in how models survive contact with
      reality, and what it takes to make them useful beyond the notebook.

  <!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">
      How I Work
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      My approach is pragmatic. I start from first principles, challenge
      assumptions early, and prefer robust solutions over fashionable ones.
      I value environments where intellectual honesty, collaboration, and
      practical execution coexist.
