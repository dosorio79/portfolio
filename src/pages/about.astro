    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">Identity</h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I work as a data scientist on pricing, marketing, and customer-related
      decisions, helping translate data analysis into choices that can be
      used in real operations.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Before moving into industry, I spent almost two decades in academic
      research studying cellular mechanics and the actomyosin cytoskeleton.
      Much of that work already involved handling complex datasets and using
      computational tools, especially in microscopy and large experimental
      screens.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Over time I became more interested in programming and data analysis,
      and gradually worked toward transitioning into applied data science
      roles outside academia.
    </p>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Today my work focuses less on models themselves and more on whether
      they help people make better decisions in practice.

  <!-- THE BRIDGE -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">What carried over from research</h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      Research left a few habits that still shape how I approach problems:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>being comfortable working with uncertainty</li>
      <li>testing ideas instead of assuming they work</li>
      <li>separating signal from noise</li>
      <li>keeping solutions as simple as possible</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Whether in research or in business contexts, the aim is usually the
      same: understand what is happening well enough to make better choices.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CURRENT FOCUS -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">
      Current focus
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I currently work on pricing and decision systems in financial
      services, with projects that typically involve:
    </p>

    <ul class="mt-4 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-slate-700">
      <li>marketing targeting and customer experience analysis</li>
      <li>experimentation and performance measurement</li>
      <li>deploying and monitoring analytical models</li>
      <li>connecting analytical results with business decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mt-4">
      Outside of work, I build small projects to explore ideas around
      learning tools and practical uses of AI, mostly as a way to keep
      learning and experimenting.

  <!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section class="mt-10 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
    <h2 class="font-sans text-lg font-semibold text-slate-900">
      How I tend to work
    </h2>

    <p class="mt-3">
      I prefer pragmatic solutions over complex ones, and environments where
      people can question assumptions, discuss trade-offs openly, and iterate
      toward something that works well enough in practice.
