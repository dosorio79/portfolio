      <p>
        I currently work on applied data science problems in the
        context of personal finance, with a focus on pricing,
        uplift modeling, interpretability, and decision support.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        My work sits at the intersection of statistical rigor,
        machine learning, and business constraints — translating
        models into decisions that can be explained, monitored,
        and improved over time.

      Research background
    </h2>

    <div class="mt-12 font-serif leading-relaxed text-slate-800">
      <p>
        Before moving into data science, I trained as an academic
        researcher in cell biology, focusing on cytoskeleton
        dynamics and actomyosin contractility.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        This background shaped how I approach problems today:
        hypothesis-driven thinking, careful interpretation of
        results, and respect for uncertainty and limitations.
