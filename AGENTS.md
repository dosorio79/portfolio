# AGENTS.md

This repository contains a personal portfolio built with Astro.
It is intentionally static, content-first, and minimal.

## Scope
- Static site only (Astro)
- No runtime JavaScript unless explicitly required
- Content is authored in Markdown and rendered at build time

## Design principles
- Typography and readability are primary
- Layouts and navigation should remain simple and calm
- Avoid visual effects, animations, or heavy interactivity

## When using AI assistance
AI tools may be used to:
- Improve clarity of copy
- Refactor components for simplicity
- Review structure and consistency

AI tools should NOT:
- Rewrite the site into a SPA
- Introduce unnecessary dependencies
- Change layout, typography, or content structure without intent

## Content changes
- New projects and publications should be added as Markdown files
- Existing content should not be auto-rewritten

If in doubt, prefer minimal changes and explicit intent.
